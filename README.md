## Dependencies

In order to use this setup you need to have installed the following dependencies:

1.  Node - min v8.15.0
2.  NPM - min v5.6.0
    or
3.  Yarn - min v1.3.2
4.  Bash terminal (Default on OSX/Linux, GitBash or similar on Windows)

## Install

```sh
yarn

# or

npm i
```

## Develop

```sh
yarn start

# or

npm start
```

This will start the application on port 5173 (if 5173 is already in use, then 5174)

Now, open `localhost:5173`
